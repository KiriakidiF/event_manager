4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
Major functionality is working, some access restrictions may not have all been completed server-side


5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
Yes, but I had to create a new user and database to get it to work. My user/database for part 2 were giving me a 500 error with no information on how to fix it, mix ecto.reset did not seem to work.
