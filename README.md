# EventManager

This project includes some code (mainly in the templates and plugs) based on lecture notes for the photoblog app.

Time:
For this version of the app, all times will be expressed in UTC.

Registration:
Users that do not upload profile pictures will have blank squares instead

Redirects:
Users that attempt to enter an event link for an event they were invited to can register / log in and will be redirected to the event's page AS LONG AS they do not reach a different page that overrides redirects first (home, Events)
